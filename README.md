# Web Services and Applications (WSAA) - Coursework

This directory contains my work for the module Web Services and Applications in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).
 
This README follows the the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in how to write README files.

## About this project

This repository contains 3 different subdirectories:

- [Assignments](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/tree/main/assignments), that include my approach to the proposed practical assignments;
- [Project](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/tree/main/project), with a web application created with a RESTful API that allows any user to interact with it;
- [My-work](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/tree/main/mywork), that includes work done regarding the labs.

Each subdirectory includes a README file with more detailed information.

In this directory there's also a .gitignore and a requirements.txt as standard.
