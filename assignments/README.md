# Web Services and Applications - Assignments

This subdirectory contains my approach to the assignments for the module Web Services and Applications in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

This README follows the instructions from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) on how to write README files.

## About this project

This subdirectory includes:

- 3 python files:
    - [assignment2-carddraw.py](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py), it's a program that reads an API that deals a deck of cards, tells the user the value and suit of his hand of cards and checks if there's any good combination;
    - [assignment03-cso.py](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment03-cso.py), reads a RESTFul API from CSO regarding the Exchequer Account (Historical Series), and saves the data in a json file;
    - [assignment04-github.py](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment04-github.py), reads a file from a repository, modifies this file and commits into my GitHub account;
- and a [json folder](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/tree/main/assignments/json), with the json files generated by the assignments 3 and 4.

Each python file corresponds to one assignment, all containing a brief explanation of the programs, the steps taken to do them, and the references that helped me to complete them. The Python code used follows the [PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) coding style as standard.

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this work is interact with API's and other files found online, developing competencies in how to interact with this type of data.

## How to run this project

To run the programs, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) need to be installed to run Python code and visualize the data on any machine. After that, this subdirectory can be [cloned in VSC](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository.md) as instructed by Microsoft.

## Dependencies

The [requirements.txt](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file, found in the root of this repository, indicates all the packages needed in order to run these programs. This file was generated through the command line with the code `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, as instructed by [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/main/docs/python/managing-required-packages-with-requirements-txt.md). To download the packages on any machine, use the code `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

The users need the programs listed above, and ensure that all dependencies are installed. To successfully run the programs, in both assignment 3 and 4, both need a slight change:
- In assignment 3, in function `getAsFile()`, in `"./json/cso.json"`, make sure you have a json folder in your current directory, otherwise just write `"./cso.json"` instead in order to generate the new file;
- In assignment 4, users need their own config.py file with the keys that they can get in their onw GitHub account. This config.py file should never be committed to GitHub as others can use these keys and make changes in our account. Then users need to change the name of the repository in `repo = g.get_repo("FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework")` with their onw, and then finally change the path where the file will be stored.

## Walkthrough of the assignments:

### The card draw: [assignment2-carddraw.py](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py)
This program uses an API that simulates a draw of a deck of cards. It shuffles and picks 5 cards. Then, it indicates the value and suit of each card and if there's any good combination. 
For this assignment, I imported the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [json](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp) libraries, then I created a variable that is the link to the API that generates a deck of cards, then I used [requests.get](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_get.asp) to shuffle the deck and store it in response. After, I got the response in JSON with [.json](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16877561). Later, I got the deck_id to use the same deck of cards for the next step. 

The second URL used represents a draw of 5 cards of this deck. Then, I actively got the cards with requests.get, store them in JSON, and [identify the cards](https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/#sequences-lists-tuples-strings-and-ranges). For each card, I print the value and suit. 

In the next step, I analysed the combinations with the function check_hand(cards). I identified the attributes for each card, with the values, suit and value_card. With [enumerate](https://realpython.com/python-enumerate/#using-pythons-enumerate), the values of the cards are connected with the value_card and create a sequence. In this hand of cards the following combinations are possible:

- Pair and/or Triple: I started checking for pairs and triples, and this can only be if the value of the card is the one right after it. If there are 2 or 3 cards with the value/key in sequence, then there's a pair or triple. I used [.append](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_append.asp) to signalize this and print the results to the user.

- Straight: To check for straight, all the cards' values need to be in sequence. The [sorted function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sorted.asp) will change the order of the values from the lowest to the highest. Then, the [while function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-while-else/) checks if there's a sequence in the values of the cards, for example, [2,3,4,5,6] is a straight.

- Flush: Finally, for the flush, all the cards must have the same suit, so I used a for function, very similar to the one that checks pairs and triples. If all the 5 cards are the same suit, then the [len](https://realpython.com/len-python-function/
) of the suit_counts will be equal to 1 because there's only 1 type of suit that is present on the cards. 

Finally, the results of the function check_hand(cards) are returned, after analysing if any of these conditions are found in the cards. If there's a pair, triple, straight or flush, the print function will be activated individually for each.

At the end, the final results are printed to the user, the pair and triple are returned as a list of the matching numbers, and the straight and the flush show as a boolean, true or false.

### The CSO: [assignment03-cso.py](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment03-cso.py)

In this assignment, the ["Exchequer Account (Historical Series)"](https://data.cso.ie/table/FIQ02) dataset from CSO is loaded and saved into a JSON file.

The libraries used are the same as in the previous task, requests and json. The URL used is the link to the data in a [RESTFul API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/#seo-faq-pairs#what-is-restful-api) provided by CSO. Then I created 2 functions:

- getInfo(), loads the data and gets the JSON [response](https://pynative.com/parse-json-response-using-python-requests-library/) into a Python dictionary;

- and getAsFile(), [creates a file](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-file-io-open-with/#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20file%20for%20writing%2C%20set%20the%20mode%20argument,in%20an%20error%20(%20FileNotFoundError%20)
) inside the subdirectory json and with the name cso.json. Then [json.dumps](https://realpython.com/python-json/#convert-python-dictionaries-to-json) converts a Python dictionary into a JSON-formatted string.

At the end, the statement [if name == "__main__"]("https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/if-name-equals-main-python#best-practices-and-tips-when-using-python's-if-__name__-==-%22__main__%22-%3Cspan") is used as a script that determines how the program runs. The function getAsFile() is called, after that, it automatically runs the other function getInfo(), as it depends on it. The file cso.json can be found [here](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/json/cso.json) as expected.

### The GitHub: [assignment04-github.py](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment04-github.py)

In this assignment, I used a file from Professor Andrew Beatty [repository in GitHub]((https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/WSAA-Courseware/blob/main/code/Topic-01-introduction%20-%20Copy/book.json)), changed this file, committed and pushed it to my repository. The libraries used are again requests and json, and also [Github](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). Then I imported the key from a config file that I created and hid it, to protect my account from others, so they can't manipulate my account. This key permits this program to commit and push the changes back to my repository.

I used the URL of the [raw version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbeattycourseware/WSAA-Courseware/main/code/Topic-01-introduction%20-%20Copy/book.json) of the JSON file from the Professor's repository. Then I loaded the file with request.get, got the contents in text with [.text](https://realpython.com/python-requests/#content) and loaded it as a python object with [json.loads](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads). Then, I created a function that checks this file, the [.replace](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp) takes a string from the original file and replaces it with the new string. I changed "Andrew Beatty" to "Fatima Oliveira". With [json.dumps](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps), the Python object is converted back as a JSON string. After that, I applied those changes to updated_content.

Now, for the program to log in to my GitHub, I needed to generate the key, as explained by [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token). After that, I indicated the path to my key in the config file, then I used [Github(apikey)](https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/) to indicate that this key is to get into my account. To finalize it, I use [.get_repo](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Repository.html) with the path to my repository that I want to [create the file in](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Repository.html#create-a-new-file-in-the-repository).

I created a new function, create_or_read(), that indicates to the machine to check if the file already exists in the `try` section, with [get_contents](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Repository.html#get-a-specific-content-file). Then, I indicated the [URL of this file](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1343#issuecomment-572907398) with the [fileInfo.download_url](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/v1.58.0/github_objects/ContentFile.html#github.ContentFile.ContentFile.download_url). Then, I got the response and turned it into text and print the contents. If the file doesn't exist, then the section `except` runs and [.create_file](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/github_objects/Repository.html#github.Repository.Repository.create_file) indicates the path for the file and the message to be committed in GitHub, with the content being the updated_content as defined above.

Again, I defined the main function of this script with the if statement, and one of the sections of create_or_read() `try` or `except` will run.
