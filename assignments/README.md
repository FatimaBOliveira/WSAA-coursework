# Web Services and Applications - Assignments

This subdirectory contains my approach to the assignments for the module Web Services and Applications in the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics course, [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

This README follows the instructions from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) on how to write README files.

## About this project

This subdirectory includes:

- 3 python files:
    - [assignment2-carddraw.py](), ;
    - [assignment03-cso.py](), ;
    - [assignment04-github.py](), ;
- and a [folder](), with the data downloaded for assignment 2.

Each python file corresponds to one assignment, all containing a brief explanation of the programs, the steps taken to do them, and the references that helped me to complete them. The Python code used follows the [PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) coding style as standard.

## Purpose of this project

## How to run this project

To run the programs, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) need to be installed to run Python code and visualize the data on any machine.

## Dependencies

The [requirements.txt](https://github.com/FatimaBOliveira/Programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file, found in the root of this repository, indicates all the packages needed in order to run these programs. This file was generated through the command line with the code `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, as instructed by [Microsoft Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/main/docs/python/managing-required-packages-with-requirements-txt.md). To download the packages on any machine, use the code `pip install -r requirements.txt`. After this, the programs should run easily on any computer.
